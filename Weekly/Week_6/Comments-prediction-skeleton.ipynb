    "# Predicting NYT Picks Comments\n",
    "The New York Times has a feature on its website called \"NYT Picks\" which is an effort by the 14 moderators on staff to select and highlight the most interesting and insightful comments that are submitted by readers. The selected comments are put in a separate user interface tab so that they're easier to find, and they get a little yellow badge which serves to highlight them further. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are various editorial criteria that the Times' staff uses to decide which comments to publish and to select as NYT Picks. Some of the criteria used are described in this [article](https://www.google.com/#safe=off&q=http:%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2Ftimes-insider%2F2014%2F04%2F17%2Fa-comments-path-to-publication%2F) (top link). Criteria used to decide to publish include: incoherency, political insults, profanity / obscenity, and insults or sterotyped condemnation. For NYT Picks they look for: high quality, broad representation, back and forth conversation, the unexpected, personal stories. Other criteria for editorial selection of comments that have been [developed from the research literature](http://www.nickdiakopoulos.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ISOJ_Journal_V5_N1_2015_Spring_Diakopoulos_Picking-NYT-Picks.pdf) include argument quality, criticality, emotionality, entertainment value, readability, personal experience, internal coherence, thoughtfulness, length, relevance, fairness, and novelty. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we're goint to try to predict whether a comment should be a NYT Pick based on other scores that we use to make that prediction. We'll first develop a prediction framework, and then for the majority of class you'll work in pairs to code a new score based on the text of the comment that can be used in that prediction framework to improve the prediction. Toward the end, we'll combine all of our scores together and see if the combination of all our scores leads to an improvement in prediction accuracy. "

Pure and simple.  One would think cooler heads in the legislature would prevail and ask the sponsors if they've really, REALLY, considered the implications of such nonsense.  It reminds me of the infamous SYG laws that give homeowners the legal cover to shoot first and ask questions later.  Just as SYG has proven to be far more problematic in practice for states and municipalities than the measure was sold on, this too, if it were ever passed, would become a nightmare--not just from a PR standpoint, but from an administrative one--that its proponents have probably refused to acknowledge because, lets face it, they might have to admit to its problems in the light of day, so best not to engage in any serious conversation about it and just press ahead with their partisan advantage.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As with all the other lessons of the past few years, let this too be an object lesson on what happens when GOtPers are elected to positions of authority.

If  you go into a wealthy neighborhood anywhere in the US--either coast, or in the middle--you will find many conservatives living the elite life too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The big dividing line is education and the work that comes with it, and the \"lifestyle\" and culture that ensue. In affluent neighborhoods of my town, organic produce is purchased by liberals and conservatives; nobody is eating at McDonalds every night. These people (lefties and righties) believe infants should be read to and that academic achievement matters, no matter how much they disparage professors. And they believe this will make kids more employable and resilient, and mostly this has worked for them. Since they're pursuing education, marriage is delayed (yes, even in Bible Belt elite communities). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But go a few counties over, and it's a very different story and a different culture. If your kids are too bookish, socially that's bad. Since the parents don't read so well themselves, nobody pushes that. Since nothing is going to happen after high school, why wait? What is there to wait for? The loss of jobs has devastated the prospects of these young people. Nobody has steady work, and nobody looks like marriage material. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And if you're local \"elite\"--small town lawyer or doctor--you try to keep your kids from being infected by the low horizons of their classmates.

On some people they will not work, and using them means you do not have your gun drawn.  Second, he was close enough for the officers to be in danger.  An attacker can run 21 feet to close with you faster than you can shoot accurately.  As he comes closer, your partners risk hitting you instead of him.  Third, a single bullet or more do not always stop an individual, unlike the movies.  Fourth, it is not feasible to shoot a moving attacker in the legs or arms.  You will miss and he will reach you.  Fifth, when an armed individual turns away from you and hides his hands, it is very possible he is preparing to use a weapon; simply because you know he has knives, doesn't mean he doesn't have a gun.  Sixth, the police are wearing combat gear to protect themselves, in a potentially lethal situation for them.  Seventh, calling a mental health professional into this situation puts that person at risk.  Eighth, unfortunately in this type of situation, when one officer fires, all too often the other officers assume he had a good reason to fire (such as seeing something they cannot see), and fire themselves.  In the split seconds available, there is no time for a consultation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neither I nor any of the people I worked with over 22 years ever wanted to kill someone.

However, now we can see how boom car laws may protect both parties.  Some comments reflect a lack of understanding of the true earth-shattering effects  these megawatt systems are capable of, which gave rise to these laws.  Bottom line here is that the incident started with the music, if not played illegally, certainly played in disregard of common sense in terms of how others might be affected, not with Dunn.  This is not to excuse what Dunn did in any way, but by first blasting the music, turning it off and then back on, this was just like an incident of road rage that escalates.  Someone cuts you off and then you pull the same thing on them.  It is a taunt, or in this case at least perhaps perceived by Dunn as a taunt, and its dangerous.

She shot herself just a few days before her 21st birthday. In an act of violent intent she went from the darling of the family to spoiled goods of society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rape needs to be removed, as do all sex crimes, from the heading of Sex Crime. They need to be accurately identified as an crime of assault with the intent to cause both psychological and physical harm. They need to be treated as such.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are more females in the world than there are males. It is long past time that we women band together and insist that every single one of gender has the same exact rights as males. As for religion, all current religions have been founded by men when women were denied all rights and had zero input to religious dogma. Therefore, no religious organization is valid in its dogma. When, and only when, women decide things shall change will there be change.</td>\n",

Some people here have said that nature is not sentimental or romantic, but the fact is that it is nature (or the Creator) who has endowed mammals, to name but one group, with love and caring for its offspring. Regardless, just because nature seems to be harsh, I don't think that gives people the right to act crassly, especially when birth control and spaying/neutering is a viable option. I think there is something to be said for the notion that the zookeepers may be acting in regard for the drawing power of baby animals to bring in the crowds, who then, unfortunately for them, become expendable once they are grown.

At first the wine was tannic and closed with the alcohol dominating the aromas, but within an hour began to show black cherry, plum and graphite.  The taste was bold, with noticeable tannins, but the black fruits continued to command (love the slight mineral notes or what I often call graphite in these wines).  It was very pleasing in that it tasted like what I wanted from a Bordeaux experience, especially at this value price.  I would buy this again.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The contradiction here is that Putin is attempting to achieve world standing and recognition of Russia’s reemergence; however, each action Putin takes, the further he becomes isolated. Despite his cavalier attitude toward the G8, it was a missed theatrical opportunity for Putin to show his nation he is standing next to the man (President Obama) whom he had blatantly disregarded. But once the wind of his country's nationalistic fervor is over, it will become apparent to Putin that sanctions may soon affect his inner circle.  It was announced that the G8 meeting was moved from Sochi to Brussels. Sochi was heavily invested in by Russia’s oligarchs; and it was Sochi that was to hold future sporting events and other world events; but if sanctions and deepening isolation progress further, Sochi will become a financial bust!   The U.S. and Russia must cooperate on issues that are both in their nation interest (Iran and Syria) and engage in frank discussions on self-determinism. Putin reminds me of Khrushchev, volatile, pugnacious and unpredictable. He witnessed his beloved Soviet Union dissolved and deteriorated into a country that resembled a Russian circus bear, big, powerful and comical. With the reemergence of Russia, Putin's actions are his way of correcting the wrongs and injustices inflicted upon his Russia.    Simply put, will sanctions and isolating Russia stop or embolden Putin to continue in his version of Manifest Destiny to counter western insolence?</td>\n",

       "2      I don't care what color lipstick is put on this 'pig' of a piece of legislation, \"free to live and work according to their faith\" is simply a fancy way of saying Arizonans should be 'free to discriminate' whomever they want to, whether due to sexual orientation, ethnicity, or religion.  Pure and simple.  One would think cooler heads in the legislature would prevail and ask the sponsors if they've really, REALLY, considered the implications of such nonsense.  It reminds me of the infamous SYG laws that give homeowners the legal cover to shoot first and ask questions later.  Just as SYG has proven to be far more problematic in practice for states and municipalities than the measure was sold on, this too, if it were ever passed, would become a nightmare--not just from a PR standpoint, but from an administrative one--that its proponents have probably refused to acknowledge because, lets face it, they might have to admit to its problems in the light of day, so best not to engage in any serious conversation about it and just press ahead with their partisan advantage.  <br/><br/>As with all the other lessons of the past few years, let this too be an object lesson on what happens when GOtPers are elected to positions of authority.  They don't say 'yes' to anything reasonable, and can't say 'no' to the most preposterous proposals.  The strange thing is, they swim against a far greater tide of public and legal opinion on issues of discrimination.  As such, it becomes a self-inflicted wound.                               \n",

If  you go into a wealthy neighborhood anywhere in the US--either coast, or in the middle--you will find many conservatives living the elite life too.<br/><br/>The big dividing line is education and the work that comes with it, and the \"lifestyle\" and culture that ensue. In affluent neighborhoods of my town, organic produce is purchased by liberals and conservatives; nobody is eating at McDonalds every night. These people (lefties and righties) believe infants should be read to and that academic achievement matters, no matter how much they disparage professors. And they believe this will make kids more employable and resilient, and mostly this has worked for them. Since they're pursuing education, marriage is delayed (yes, even in Bible Belt elite communities). <br/><br/>But go a few counties over, and it's a very different story and a different culture. If your kids are too bookish, socially that's bad. Since the parents don't read so well themselves, nobody pushes that. Since nothing is going to happen after high school, why wait? What is there to wait for? The loss of jobs has devastated the prospects of these young people. Nobody has steady work, and nobody looks like marriage material. <br/><br/>And if you're local \"elite\"--small town lawyer or doctor--you try to keep your kids from being infected by the low horizons of their classmates. Given the anti-intellectual climate you live in, you too plan to leave town ASAP.            \n",

You don't find this out until you go to your appointment and get asked to pay hundreds of dollars  up front because they don't take your insurance.

All people have gotta do is read about Reconstruction after the Civil War.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "16     I've no doubt they discovered something significant, and congratulations are certainly in order.<br/><br/>But my opinion is that they need a different set of theories to explain these discoveries.  I don't mean to detract from them and this is just my opinion, but I've always been confused by their concepts and what appear to be contradictory conclusions.<br/><br/>Something cannot come from nothing. A is not B. A is A. Isn't it a a contradiction to say otherwise?  Isn't it obvious that the universe has always been here and will always be here.  Doesn't the Big Bang Theory violate the law of conservation of energy?   <br/><br/>And \"space-time fabric\" just seems wrong to me.  Space is just the distance between objects, and not an object itself. It's not a concrete thing, it's just an abstract concept. Time is just a way to measure the relationship between events. Again...just a concept. It is abstract.  How can space-time fabric be an actual thing in nature?<br/><br/>If these are gravity waves, then what is their frequency and amplitude?

They make these humongous signs and post open interview times where people do not even have to previously apply. Just show up within the appointed time frame with a mini-application in hand and you will get interviewed. It's ridiculous to think that people are unemployed through no fault of their own. That tired old line is dispelled by all the unfilled positions that employers are begging to be filled everyday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "20     Less jobs equals less consumer spending money equals a possible fighting chance for the planet?<br/><br/>People motivated to work less could possibly mean less people driving on the roads, less oil being used and fewer fossil fuel emissions.   With less money to spend on energy, maybe the planet will have a fighting chance?<br/>Maybe this opportunity will give consumers a reality check on how they want to spend their money? If they are going to work less, maybe they want their planet to be in better shape if they actual have time to go to the beach or hiking?  Or maybe now they will have the time to think about long term engery investments instead of short time disposable ones that ruin our planet.

       "25054  A few comments from a retired law enforcement officer:  First, the taser and bean bags did not work on this individual.  On some people they will not work, and using them means you do not have your gun drawn.  Second, he was close enough for the officers to be in danger.  An attacker can run 21 feet to close with you faster than you can shoot accurately.  As he comes closer, your partners risk hitting you instead of him.  Third, a single bullet or more do not always stop an individual, unlike the movies.  Fourth, it is not feasible to shoot a moving attacker in the legs or arms.  You will miss and he will reach you.  Fifth, when an armed individual turns away from you and hides his hands, it is very possible he is preparing to use a weapon; simply because you know he has knives, doesn't mean he doesn't have a gun.  Sixth, the police are wearing combat gear to protect themselves, in a potentially lethal situation for them.  Seventh, calling a mental health professional into this situation puts that person at risk.  Eighth, unfortunately in this type of situation, when one officer fires, all too often the other officers assume he had a good reason to fire (such as seeing something they cannot see), and fire themselves.  In the split seconds available, there is no time for a consultation.  <br/><br/>Neither I nor any of the people I worked with over 22 years ever wanted to kill someone.  That was not the reason we became law enforcement officers.                                                                     \n",
       "25055  Did Dunn provoke the incident, or did the \"music\" provoke Dunn.  Most comments indicate that Dunn \"started it\".  In many states, it is illegal to blast car stereos past a certain distance.  Florida's \"boom car\" law was recently overturned on free speech grounds.  However, now we can see how boom car laws may protect both parties.  Some comments reflect a lack of understanding of the true earth-shattering effects  these megawatt systems are capable of, which gave rise to these laws.  Bottom line here is that the incident started with the music, if not played illegally, certainly played in disregard of common sense in terms of how others might be affected, not with Dunn.  This is not to excuse what Dunn did in any way, but by first blasting the music, turning it off and then back on, this was just like an incident of road rage that escalates.  Someone cuts you off and then you pull the same thing on them.  It is a taunt, or in this case at least perhaps perceived by Dunn as a taunt, and its dangerous.  And as in the case of road rage, these days you've just got to assume the other guy is armed and is looking for an excuse to act.  Car stereo manufacturers, retailers and private venues like convenience stores, need to provide warnings about noise laws and hearing loss effects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "25056  I, for one, was surprised that Mr Obama was even remotely interested in running for office for a second term after the noxious way he was treated by the opposition party.  But he felt that he had not accomplished enough and the decision was made.  There is a steel core to this man.  What Republicans in the end will create is to make this president a kind of martyr, a symbol for human kindness and thoughtfulness.

       "25059  An interesting parallel:  The Ukrainian Parliament is reestablishing their original Constitution in which Parliament was given more power than the executive; shades of the American Constitution which sought to give more power to the House of (the peoples) Representatives.  Congratulations to the people.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the Ukrainian people, neither side, are disposed to democracy and Constitutional rule.  The most likely outcome of the current interregnum will be the split of the country into two states.  That will reduce the amount of blood to be shed.  It will give time for the people to come to an agreement as to the future of the Ukraine: for ever split or a federal union with perhaps a weak national government akin to the Confederation that attempted to rule the US before the crafting of the American Constitution.  A strong Ukraine-wide government created tomorrow will only increase the death toll in the streets of Kiev and elsewhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "25060  My sister was raped with a knife held to her throat just days after she turned 12 in Indio, California in 1969. The rapist was a man in his forties and was never arrested even though he was identified as the rapist and bore the bite mark of my sister's teeth to his shoulder. She shot herself just a few days before her 21st birthday. In an act of violent intent she went from the darling of the family to spoiled goods of society.<br/><br/>Rape needs to be removed, as do all sex crimes, from the heading of Sex Crime. They need to be accurately identified as an crime of assault with the intent to cause both psychological and physical harm. They need to be treated as such.<br/><br/>There are more females in the world than there are males. It is long past time that we women band together and insist that every single one of gender has the same exact rights as males. As for religion, all current religions have been founded by men when women were denied all rights and had zero input to religious dogma. Therefore, no religious organization is valid in its dogma. When, and only when, women decide things shall change will there be change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "25061  When I was a kid, there was a book called \"What Is a Million?\" or some such, and it consisted of a million dots--with dots pulled out to the margin accompanied by a note about what that number signified. I remember it made a big impression on me and my friends--to see how big a million was, and to see proportions (what is 100,000 compared to one million?). I have always thought back to that book when I hear about numbers of people being killed in any situation. One person being killed is horrific. A million, six million...unfathomable.<br/>I wonder if \"And Every Single One Was Someone\" had been punctuated with real names, or stories pulled out into the margin, would it have a different, perhaps more powerful effect and cause less controversy?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

My distress was so deep that the the bed was too comfortable. And my knees—to which I had sunk many times, in seeking help from God—were too elevated. I walked into my hallway, the most vacant place in my home, lay down on the hard floor and sobbed. I knew I could not go lower, and that it would pass, and I then turned to the wall and lay my head on my arm. It was strangely comforting and I thought, \"I might fall asleep, here.\" In time, I returned to bed. <br/><br/>I talked through the experience the next day with people who care for me, and sure enough, the pain lifted.<br/><br/>I appreciate the thoughts in this article and its message of healing.

       "25069  When the death penalty has been on the rise over the years, it means one of many crucial things: the death penalty is not longer an efficient deterrent of crime. Finding the most \"humane\" way of killing someone is a social problem; it reflects the asymmetric relationship between the government, the judiciary and the people. It reflects the misplaced authority in partial and biased heads of power that is difficult to refute when, on the face of it, the main exercise of such power is to \"restore justice and protect society from dangerous criminals\". <br/><br/>But it is not. Crime is prevailing. The death penalty is no deterrent.

In the case of Marius, he was killed by a shotgun blast to the head. That, in my view, does not constitute euthanasia, and in fact would open the zoo to animal cruelty charges here in North America.<br/>As a person with Danish blood, I am shocked and disgusted that the Danish zoo would take this elitist view toward the animals in its care. Some people here have said that nature is not sentimental or romantic, but the fact is that it is nature (or the Creator) who has endowed mammals, to name but one group, with love and caring for its offspring. Regardless, just because nature seems to be harsh, I don't think that gives people the right to act crassly, especially when birth control and spaying/neutering is a viable option. I think there is something to be said for the notion that the zookeepers may be acting in regard for the drawing power of baby animals to bring in the crowds, who then, unfortunately for them, become expendable once they are grown. I think this practice reflects a failure of effective management of a precious resource.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

Each of us could do more, and so easily. How much could we change for our daughters with subtle shifts in language alone? <br/><br/>As the mother of two sons (one in college, one just graduated), I can see that my boys feel as if they \"own\" themselves and their choices. Many of their friends of the same age are female; they're focused and ambitious - for now. They're attending great schools and pursuing interesting subjects. The rubber hits the road when they get into their careers, assuming the economy allows for it, and over the next 5 to 10 years, when they must make choices dealing with work and motherhood.<br/><br/>These tough choices (sacrificed skills, earnings, dreams) are still predominantly made by women.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://dailyplateofcrazy.com/2013/08/13/girl-gaps-working-mothers-women-owning-choices/\" title=\"http://dailyplateofcrazy.com/2013/08/13/girl-gaps-working-mothers-women-owning-choices/\" target=\"_blank\">http://dailyplateofcrazy.com/2013/08/13/girl-gaps-working-mothers-women-...</a>   \n",

       "25077  Chateau Devise d'Ardilley Haut-Medoc 2009:  At the request of my \"go to\" wine guy Adam, I purchased this $18 value buy.  At first the wine was tannic and closed with the alcohol dominating the aromas, but within an hour began to show black cherry, plum and graphite.  The taste was bold, with noticeable tannins, but the black fruits continued to command (love the slight mineral notes or what I often call graphite in these wines).  It was very pleasing in that it tasted like what I wanted from a Bordeaux experience, especially at this value price.  I would buy this again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "25079  The contradiction here is that Putin is attempting to achieve world standing and recognition of Russia’s reemergence; however, each action Putin takes, the further he becomes isolated. Despite his cavalier attitude toward the G8, it was a missed theatrical opportunity for Putin to show his nation he is standing next to the man (President Obama) whom he had blatantly disregarded. But once the wind of his country's nationalistic fervor is over, it will become apparent to Putin that sanctions may soon affect his inner circle.  It was announced that the G8 meeting was moved from Sochi to Brussels. Sochi was heavily invested in by Russia’s oligarchs; and it was Sochi that was to hold future sporting events and other world events; but if sanctions and deepening isolation progress further, Sochi will become a financial bust!   The U.S. and Russia must cooperate on issues that are both in their nation interest (Iran and Syria) and engage in frank discussions on self-determinism. Putin reminds me of Khrushchev, volatile, pugnacious and unpredictable. He witnessed his beloved Soviet Union dissolved and deteriorated into a country that resembled a Russian circus bear, big, powerful and comical. With the reemergence of Russia, Putin's actions are his way of correcting the wrongs and injustices inflicted upon his Russia.    Simply put, will sanctions and isolating Russia stop or embolden Putin to continue in his version of Manifest Destiny to counter western insolence?                                                        \n",

       "25081  Let's face - the President has used every opportunity to demonize the Republicans for the past 5 years and has put little effort into building relationships, trust building through working on bi-partisan measures or simply negotiating for issues that are important to his agenda.

President Clinton played hardball in the political arena - but worked behind the scenes with Gingrich/Dole where needed.<br/><br/>Plenty of ranting being done on both sides of the aisle but a serious President doesn't take it personally and demonstrates leadership.

This is called **supervised learning** -- the learning process is supervised in the sense that we're already given it the answer. The power of this of course is that once the learning process is complete we can use the model that was learned to apply it to *new comments* for which we don't yet know if it should be an NYT Pick or not. \n",

To find possible features that may have some predictive power (not all features will), we might start by doing a bit of exploratory analysis. Lets see how the mean and median recommendation count varies between comments that were picked and those that weren't.\n"

On some people they will not work, and using them means you do not have your gun drawn.  Second, he was close enough for the officers to be in danger.  An attacker can run 21 feet to close with you faster than you can shoot accurately.  As he comes closer, your partners risk hitting you instead of him.  Third, a single bullet or more do not always stop an individual, unlike the movies.  Fourth, it is not feasible to shoot a moving attacker in the legs or arms.  You will miss and he will reach you.  Fifth, when an armed individual turns away from you and hides his hands, it is very possible he is preparing to use a weapon; simply because you know he has knives, doesn't mean he doesn't have a gun.  Sixth, the police are wearing combat gear to protect themselves, in a potentially lethal situation for them.  Seventh, calling a mental health professional into this situation puts that person at risk.  Eighth, unfortunately in this type of situation, when one officer fires, all too often the other officers assume he had a good reason to fire (such as seeing something they cannot see), and fire themselves.  In the split seconds available, there is no time for a consultation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neither I nor any of the people I worked with over 22 years ever wanted to kill someone.  That was not the reason we became law enforcement officers.</td>\n",

In many states, it is illegal to blast car stereos past a certain distance.  Florida's \"boom car\" law was recently overturned on free speech grounds.  However, now we can see how boom car laws may protect both parties.  Some comments reflect a lack of understanding of the true earth-shattering effects  these megawatt systems are capable of, which gave rise to these laws.  Bottom line here is that the incident started with the music, if not played illegally, certainly played in disregard of common sense in terms of how others might be affected, not with Dunn.  This is not to excuse what Dunn did in any way, but by first blasting the music, turning it off and then back on, this was just like an incident of road rage that escalates.  Someone cuts you off and then you pull the same thing on them.  It is a taunt, or in this case at least perhaps perceived by Dunn as a taunt, and its dangerous.  And as in the case of road rage, these days you've just got to assume the other guy is armed and is looking for an excuse to act.  Car stereo manufacturers, retailers and private venues like convenience stores, need to provide warnings about noise laws and hearing loss effects.</td>\n",

In the case of Marius, he was killed by a shotgun blast to the head. That, in my view, does not constitute euthanasia, and in fact would open the zoo to animal cruelty charges here in North America.&lt;br/&gt;As a person with Danish blood, I am shocked and disgusted that the Danish zoo would take this elitist view toward the animals in its care. Some people here have said that nature is not sentimental or romantic, but the fact is that it is nature (or the Creator) who has endowed mammals, to name but one group, with love and caring for its offspring. Regardless, just because nature seems to be harsh, I don't think that gives people the right to act crassly, especially when birth control and spaying/neutering is a viable option. I think there is something to be said for the notion that the zookeepers may be acting in regard for the drawing power of baby animals to bring in the crowds, who then, unfortunately for them, become expendable once they are grown. I think this practice reflects a failure of effective management of a precious resource.</td>\n",

The rubber hits the road when they get into their careers, assuming the economy allows for it, and over the next 5 to 10 years, when they must make choices dealing with work and motherhood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These tough choices (sacrificed skills, earnings, dreams) are still predominantly made by women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://dailyplateofcrazy.com/2013/08/13/girl-gaps-working-mothers-women-owning-choices/\" title=\"http://dailyplateofcrazy.com/2013/08/13/girl-gaps-working-mothers-women-owning-choices/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;http://dailyplateofcrazy.com/2013/08/13/girl-gaps-working-mothers-women-...&lt;/a&gt;</td>\n",

Despite his cavalier attitude toward the G8, it was a missed theatrical opportunity for Putin to show his nation he is standing next to the man (President Obama) whom he had blatantly disregarded. But once the wind of his country's nationalistic fervor is over, it will become apparent to Putin that sanctions may soon affect his inner circle.  It was announced that the G8 meeting was moved from Sochi to Brussels. Sochi was heavily invested in by Russia’s oligarchs; and it was Sochi that was to hold future sporting events and other world events; but if sanctions and deepening isolation progress further, Sochi will become a financial bust!   The U.S. and Russia must cooperate on issues that are both in their nation interest (Iran and Syria) and engage in frank discussions on self-determinism. Putin reminds me of Khrushchev, volatile, pugnacious and unpredictable. He witnessed his beloved Soviet Union dissolved and deteriorated into a country that resembled a Russian circus bear, big, powerful and comical. With the reemergence of Russia, Putin's actions are his way of correcting the wrongs and injustices inflicted upon his Russia.    Simply put, will sanctions and isolating Russia stop or embolden Putin to continue in his version of Manifest Destiny to counter western insolence?</td>\n",

       "2      I don't care what color lipstick is put on this 'pig' of a piece of legislation, \"free to live and work according to their faith\" is simply a fancy way of saying Arizonans should be 'free to discriminate' whomever they want to, whether due to sexual orientation, ethnicity, or religion.  Pure and simple.  One would think cooler heads in the legislature would prevail and ask the sponsors if they've really, REALLY, considered the implications of such nonsense.  It reminds me of the infamous SYG laws that give homeowners the legal cover to shoot first and ask questions later.  Just as SYG has proven to be far more problematic in practice for states and municipalities than the measure was sold on, this too, if it were ever passed, would become a nightmare--not just from a PR standpoint, but from an administrative one--that its proponents have probably refused to acknowledge because, lets face it, they might have to admit to its problems in the light of day, so best not to engage in any serious conversation about it and just press ahead with their partisan advantage.  <br/><br/>As with all the other lessons of the past few years, let this too be an object lesson on what happens when GOtPers are elected to positions of authority.  They don't say 'yes' to anything reasonable, and can't say 'no' to the most preposterous proposals.  The strange thing is, they swim against a far greater tide of public and legal opinion on issues of discrimination.  As such, it becomes a self-inflicted wound.                               \n",

       "5      I'm not sure where Ross encounters \"elites\"; but he needs to branch out more. If  you go into a wealthy neighborhood anywhere in the US--either coast, or in the middle--you will find many conservatives living the elite life too.<br/><br/>The big dividing line is education and the work that comes with it, and the \"lifestyle\" and culture that ensue. In affluent neighborhoods of my town, organic produce is purchased by liberals and conservatives; nobody is eating at McDonalds every night. These people (lefties and righties) believe infants should be read to and that academic achievement matters, no matter how much they disparage professors. And they believe this will make kids more employable and resilient, and mostly this has worked for them. Since they're pursuing education, marriage is delayed (yes, even in Bible Belt elite communities). <br/><br/>But go a few counties over, and it's a very different story and a different culture. If your kids are too bookish, socially that's bad. Since the parents don't read so well themselves, nobody pushes that. Since nothing is going to happen after high school, why wait? What is there to wait for? The loss of jobs has devastated the prospects of these young people. Nobody has steady work, and nobody looks like marriage material. <br/><br/>And if you're local \"elite\"--small town lawyer or doctor--you try to keep your kids from being infected by the low horizons of their classmates. Given the anti-intellectual climate you live in, you too plan to leave town ASAP.            \n",
       "6      I second what Nina just wrote.   The NY exchange plans are lying about which doctors are in their  networks.   Today I found out that NONE of my doctors are accepting any of the exchange plans - even though they ARE on the plans' official lists of providers.   You don't find this out until you go to your appointment and get asked to pay hundreds of dollars  up front because they don't take your insurance.  The insurance companies are just lying to get people's money.  They know we'd never pick their plans if they were honest about how lousy their networks are.

       "16     I've no doubt they discovered something significant, and congratulations are certainly in order.<br/><br/>But my opinion is that they need a different set of theories to explain these discoveries.  I don't mean to detract from them and this is just my opinion, but I've always been confused by their concepts and what appear to be contradictory conclusions.<br/><br/>Something cannot come from nothing. A is not B. A is A. Isn't it a a contradiction to say otherwise?  Isn't it obvious that the universe has always been here and will always be here.  Doesn't the Big Bang Theory violate the law of conservation of energy?   <br/><br/>And \"space-time fabric\" just seems wrong to me.  Space is just the distance between objects, and not an object itself. It's not a concrete thing, it's just an abstract concept. Time is just a way to measure the relationship between events. Again...just a concept. It is abstract.  How can space-time fabric be an actual thing in nature?<br/><br/>If these are gravity waves, then what is their frequency and amplitude?  Which direction are they traveling?  How fast are they traveling?  What are they waves within?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "18     I travel around the country for my job and I see help wanted signs every where I go. From a McDonalds in Bozeman MT to a manufacturing plant in Dysert IA. They make these humongous signs and post open interview times where people do not even have to previously apply. Just show up within the appointed time frame with a mini-application in hand and you will get interviewed. It's ridiculous to think that people are unemployed through no fault of their own. That tired old line is dispelled by all the unfilled positions that employers are begging to be filled everyday.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "20     Less jobs equals less consumer spending money equals a possible fighting chance for the planet?<br/><br/>People motivated to work less could possibly mean less people driving on the roads, less oil being used and fewer fossil fuel emissions.   With less money to spend on energy, maybe the planet will have a fighting chance?<br/>Maybe this opportunity will give consumers a reality check on how they want to spend their money? If they are going to work less, maybe they want their planet to be in better shape if they actual have time to go to the beach or hiking?  Or maybe now they will have the time to think about long term engery investments instead of short time disposable ones that ruin our planet.

       "25054  A few comments from a retired law enforcement officer:  First, the taser and bean bags did not work on this individual.  On some people they will not work, and using them means you do not have your gun drawn.  Second, he was close enough for the officers to be in danger.  An attacker can run 21 feet to close with you faster than you can shoot accurately.  As he comes closer, your partners risk hitting you instead of him.  Third, a single bullet or more do not always stop an individual, unlike the movies.  Fourth, it is not feasible to shoot a moving attacker in the legs or arms.  You will miss and he will reach you.  Fifth, when an armed individual turns away from you and hides his hands, it is very possible he is preparing to use a weapon; simply because you know he has knives, doesn't mean he doesn't have a gun.  Sixth, the police are wearing combat gear to protect themselves, in a potentially lethal situation for them.  Seventh, calling a mental health professional into this situation puts that person at risk.  Eighth, unfortunately in this type of situation, when one officer fires, all too often the other officers assume he had a good reason to fire (such as seeing something they cannot see), and fire themselves.  In the split seconds available, there is no time for a consultation.  <br/><br/>Neither I nor any of the people I worked with over 22 years ever wanted to kill someone.  That was not the reason we became law enforcement officers.                                                                     \n",
       "25055  Did Dunn provoke the incident, or did the \"music\" provoke Dunn.  Most comments indicate that Dunn \"started it\".  In many states, it is illegal to blast car stereos past a certain distance.  Florida's \"boom car\" law was recently overturned on free speech grounds.  However, now we can see how boom car laws may protect both parties.  Some comments reflect a lack of understanding of the true earth-shattering effects  these megawatt systems are capable of, which gave rise to these laws.  Bottom line here is that the incident started with the music, if not played illegally, certainly played in disregard of common sense in terms of how others might be affected, not with Dunn.  This is not to excuse what Dunn did in any way, but by first blasting the music, turning it off and then back on, this was just like an incident of road rage that escalates.  Someone cuts you off and then you pull the same thing on them.  It is a taunt, or in this case at least perhaps perceived by Dunn as a taunt, and its dangerous.  And as in the case of road rage, these days you've just got to assume the other guy is armed and is looking for an excuse to act.  Car stereo manufacturers, retailers and private venues like convenience stores, need to provide warnings about noise laws and hearing loss effects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "25056  I, for one, was surprised that Mr Obama was even remotely interested in running for office for a second term after the noxious way he was treated by the opposition party.  But he felt that he had not accomplished enough and the decision was made.  There is a steel core to this man.  What Republicans in the end will create is to make this president a kind of martyr, a symbol for human kindness and thoughtfulness.

       "25059  An interesting parallel:  The Ukrainian Parliament is reestablishing their original Constitution in which Parliament was given more power than the executive; shades of the American Constitution which sought to give more power to the House of (the peoples) Representatives.  Congratulations to the people.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the Ukrainian people, neither side, are disposed to democracy and Constitutional rule.  The most likely outcome of the current interregnum will be the split of the country into two states.  That will reduce the amount of blood to be shed.  It will give time for the people to come to an agreement as to the future of the Ukraine: for ever split or a federal union with perhaps a weak national government akin to the Confederation that attempted to rule the US before the crafting of the American Constitution.  A strong Ukraine-wide government created tomorrow will only increase the death toll in the streets of Kiev and elsewhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "25060  My sister was raped with a knife held to her throat just days after she turned 12 in Indio, California in 1969. The rapist was a man in his forties and was never arrested even though he was identified as the rapist and bore the bite mark of my sister's teeth to his shoulder. She shot herself just a few days before her 21st birthday. In an act of violent intent she went from the darling of the family to spoiled goods of society.<br/><br/>Rape needs to be removed, as do all sex crimes, from the heading of Sex Crime. They need to be accurately identified as an crime of assault with the intent to cause both psychological and physical harm. They need to be treated as such.<br/><br/>There are more females in the world than there are males. It is long past time that we women band together and insist that every single one of gender has the same exact rights as males. As for religion, all current religions have been founded by men when women were denied all rights and had zero input to religious dogma. Therefore, no religious organization is valid in its dogma. When, and only when, women decide things shall change will there be change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "25061  When I was a kid, there was a book called \"What Is a Million?\" or some such, and it consisted of a million dots--with dots pulled out to the margin accompanied by a note about what that number signified. I remember it made a big impression on me and my friends--to see how big a million was, and to see proportions (what is 100,000 compared to one million?). I have always thought back to that book when I hear about numbers of people being killed in any situation. One person being killed is horrific. A million, six million...unfathomable.<br/>I wonder if \"And Every Single One Was Someone\" had been punctuated with real names, or stories pulled out into the margin, would it have a different, perhaps more powerful effect and cause less controversy?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

My distress was so deep that the the bed was too comfortable. And my knees—to which I had sunk many times, in seeking help from God—were too elevated. I walked into my hallway, the most vacant place in my home, lay down on the hard floor and sobbed. I knew I could not go lower, and that it would pass, and I then turned to the wall and lay my head on my arm. It was strangely comforting and I thought, \"I might fall asleep, here.\" In time, I returned to bed. <br/><br/>I talked through the experience the next day with people who care for me, and sure enough, the pain lifted.<br/><br/>I appreciate the thoughts in this article and its message of healing.

       "25069  When the death penalty has been on the rise over the years, it means one of many crucial things: the death penalty is not longer an efficient deterrent of crime. Finding the most \"humane\" way of killing someone is a social problem; it reflects the asymmetric relationship between the government, the judiciary and the people. It reflects the misplaced authority in partial and biased heads of power that is difficult to refute when, on the face of it, the main exercise of such power is to \"restore justice and protect society from dangerous criminals\". <br/><br/>But it is not. Crime is prevailing. The death penalty is no deterrent.

In the case of Marius, he was killed by a shotgun blast to the head. That, in my view, does not constitute euthanasia, and in fact would open the zoo to animal cruelty charges here in North America.<br/>As a person with Danish blood, I am shocked and disgusted that the Danish zoo would take this elitist view toward the animals in its care. Some people here have said that nature is not sentimental or romantic, but the fact is that it is nature (or the Creator) who has endowed mammals, to name but one group, with love and caring for its offspring. Regardless, just because nature seems to be harsh, I don't think that gives people the right to act crassly, especially when birth control and spaying/neutering is a viable option. I think there is something to be said for the notion that the zookeepers may be acting in regard for the drawing power of baby animals to bring in the crowds, who then, unfortunately for them, become expendable once they are grown. I think this practice reflects a failure of effective management of a precious resource.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

Each of us could do more, and so easily. How much could we change for our daughters with subtle shifts in language alone? <br/><br/>As the mother of two sons (one in college, one just graduated), I can see that my boys feel as if they \"own\" themselves and their choices. Many of their friends of the same age are female; they're focused and ambitious - for now. They're attending great schools and pursuing interesting subjects. The rubber hits the road when they get into their careers, assuming the economy allows for it, and over the next 5 to 10 years, when they must make choices dealing with work and motherhood.<br/><br/>These tough choices (sacrificed skills, earnings, dreams) are still predominantly made by women.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://dailyplateofcrazy.com/2013/08/13/girl-gaps-working-mothers-women-owning-choices/\" title=\"http://dailyplateofcrazy.com/2013/08/13/girl-gaps-working-mothers-women-owning-choices/\" target=\"_blank\">http://dailyplateofcrazy.com/2013/08/13/girl-gaps-working-mothers-women-...</a>   \n",

       "25077  Chateau Devise d'Ardilley Haut-Medoc 2009:  At the request of my \"go to\" wine guy Adam, I purchased this $18 value buy.  At first the wine was tannic and closed with the alcohol dominating the aromas, but within an hour began to show black cherry, plum and graphite.  The taste was bold, with noticeable tannins, but the black fruits continued to command (love the slight mineral notes or what I often call graphite in these wines).  It was very pleasing in that it tasted like what I wanted from a Bordeaux experience, especially at this value price.  I would buy this again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "25079  The contradiction here is that Putin is attempting to achieve world standing and recognition of Russia’s reemergence; however, each action Putin takes, the further he becomes isolated. Despite his cavalier attitude toward the G8, it was a missed theatrical opportunity for Putin to show his nation he is standing next to the man (President Obama) whom he had blatantly disregarded. But once the wind of his country's nationalistic fervor is over, it will become apparent to Putin that sanctions may soon affect his inner circle.  It was announced that the G8 meeting was moved from Sochi to Brussels. Sochi was heavily invested in by Russia’s oligarchs; and it was Sochi that was to hold future sporting events and other world events; but if sanctions and deepening isolation progress further, Sochi will become a financial bust!   The U.S. and Russia must cooperate on issues that are both in their nation interest (Iran and Syria) and engage in frank discussions on self-determinism. Putin reminds me of Khrushchev, volatile, pugnacious and unpredictable. He witnessed his beloved Soviet Union dissolved and deteriorated into a country that resembled a Russian circus bear, big, powerful and comical. With the reemergence of Russia, Putin's actions are his way of correcting the wrongs and injustices inflicted upon his Russia.    Simply put, will sanctions and isolating Russia stop or embolden Putin to continue in his version of Manifest Destiny to counter western insolence?                                                        \n",

       "25081  Let's face - the President has used every opportunity to demonize the Republicans for the past 5 years and has put little effort into building relationships, trust building through working on bi-partisan measures or simply negotiating for issues that are important to his agenda.

President Clinton played hardball in the political arena - but worked behind the scenes with Gingrich/Dole where needed.<br/><br/>Plenty of ranting being done on both sides of the aisle but a serious President doesn't take it personally and demonstrates leadership.
