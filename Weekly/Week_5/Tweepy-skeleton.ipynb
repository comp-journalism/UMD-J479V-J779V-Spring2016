Unless you want to pollute your own Twitter timeline (if you already use it) then you'll want to create a new account. A helpful tip from Dan Nguyen at Stanford is that it's easiest to register the new Twitter account with the email address of yournormalname+mytwitterbot@gmail.com. GMail will redirect all of those emails to your normal gmail account but Twitter things its a unique email address. \n",
