There are many pitfalls to be aware of when you're trying to make something as subjective as human emotion in a quantifiable number. Simple approaches often do not account for even basic linguistic structures like negations (e.g. \"I'm *not* sad today\"). Take these results with a grain of salt, but also be aware that there often is *some* signal in all of the ambiguous noise of text."
